### <p align='center'>Android "Base" Project</p>

#### App is developed on Android (Kotlin)

### Introduction 
  * This is an <kbd> <br> Android-base <br> </kbd> project, which enables developer to build and scale application on it.
  * It is build using Kotlin and MVVM.
  * Uses Kotlin Coroutine for asynchronous operations and utilises Kotlin Coroutine's **suspended** functionality for I/O and network operations.
  * It uses **Retrofit** to interact with server APIs.
  * UI is based on <kbd> <br> Single Activity <br> </kbd> and <kbd> <br> multiple Fragments <br> </kbd> model.
  * It has common functions initiated in base classes; which enables developer to speed up development.
  * It uses DataBinding which enables 2-way communication (binding) with UI.
  * It is equipped with <kbd> <br> Kotlin Generics <br> </kbd> which empowers this application to be consistent and allow developer to design application in symmetric manner

### Structure and Libraries used:
  - <kbd> <br> Kotlin <br> </kbd> is used to develop this application
  - <kbd> <br> MVVM <br> </kbd> Architectural Patterns is used to design the solution
  - Design patterns <kbd> <br> Singleton, Observer, Dependency Injection <br> </kbd> used as per need
  - Third-party Libraries <kbd> <br> Retrofit <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Kotlin Coroutines <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Gson Converter <br> </kbd> were used
  - Jetpack Libraries <kbd> <br> Fragments <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Databinding <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Navigation <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> RecyclerView <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> WorkManager <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> ViewPager <br> </kbd> used to design
  - <kbd> <br> Hilt <br> </kbd> Dagger based Dependency injection used


 ### App limitations / restrictions
   - This is totally a blank "Base" application for Android.
   - Developer can use available bases classes to develop application on it.
   - And it contains commonly used methods, includes: Handle arguments, progress, snack bar and toast and UI inflate methods

### How to Use
  - Clone it on your device
  - Extend <kbd> <br> Activity <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Fragment <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> ViewModel <br> </kbd> <kbd> <br> Repo <br> </kbd> from the respective base classes

## And you are good to go
